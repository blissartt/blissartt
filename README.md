## Hi there, I'm blissartt!
#### Always hungry for new things to learn!
==============

== I'm Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This repo is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  I am deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

Any use of this repo's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  I do not consent to GitHub's use of this repo's
code in Copilot.
